## Overview

Having a good attack strategy is key to winning a Voidpet battle. This article will go over some [general tips when attacking](#attacking-tips). Then, we'll go through [attacking another Voidpet step by step](#attacking-a-step-by-step-guide).

*Note: This article doesn't include type matching, which is confirmed by anecdotal evidence. You can learn about type matching [here](/type-matching).*

## Attacking Tips

- **[Boost your skills](/bond-and-skills**. While there are no builds for Voidpets yet, you're welcome to experiment with being a glass cannon, tank, or something else.

- **Fight battles you can win**. While based on anecdotal evidence, battling slightly lower level pets seems easier, especially if you can keep going without healing. The less XP and void matter seems to be counterweighted by the fact that you can do more fights

- **Don't use ineffective attacks**. Rather than wasting attack points on things like Gatekeep, keep up to 2 attack points which will roll over to the next turn. 

## Using the Correct Attacks

### Match attacks with your skills

Matching attacks to your skills is key to being able to do a lot of damage.

Let's check out my skills on my profile:

![skills page](/wiki/skills-page.png)

My highest in the attack power category is Satisfaction. If we look at the [skills table](/bond-and-skills#skills), Satisfaction corresponds with energy damage, aka mental damage. If you want to learn how to permanently boost your skills, you can go [here](/bond-and-skills#permanently-boost-your-stats). Now that I know that, let's attack someone. In my attack menu, I have jitters and panic ball. Let's learn a bit more about those skills:

First, I'm going to press the [i] button in the UI:

Let's see what's inside that page:

The Panic ball attack is an attack that does `mental damage` while Jitters does physical damage. For brevity, we'll ignore the amount of damage each attack does. If we go back to my skills, I do more damage with energy attacks rather than physical attacks, so I'll invoke the Panic ball attack.

### Use Stat Changing Attacks First

You should use attacks with effects before using entirely damage based attacks. If you plan to use multiple attacks, i.e. dark blast and panic ball, it would make sense to invoke Panic ball then Dark blast. Let's explore why:

First, I'm going to press the [i] button in the UI:

Let's see what's inside that page:

- Dark blast is a strong attack with a good amount of Mental and Pure damage. It doesn't seem to have any effects.

- Panic ball does only mental damage and less of it too, but it has an effect: `lower target's serenity by 10%`. If we look at the [skills table](/bond-and-skills#skills), we can see serenity lowers energy defense, aka [mental defense](#damage-types-full). If we lower the mental defense first, we'll be able to do more damage with a Dark blast attack!

Remember, we're planning on using **both** of these attacks. In this case, Panic ball essentially sets up Dark blast to do more damage, so we'll use it first. 

## Damage Types Full

We recommend looking at [this table](/bond-and-skills#skills) to learn what skill corresponds to the type of damage. As far as we know, physical damage and mental damage both affect the opponents' health bar in the same way.

### Mental Damage

Mental damage is affected by satisfaction and serenity.

### Physical Damage

Physical damage is affected by confidence and concentration.

### Pure Damage

Pure damage is a type of damage that isn't affected by skills.
